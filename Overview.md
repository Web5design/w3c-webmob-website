% Web and Mobile Interest Group (WebMob)

Mission
-------

As defined in its
[charter](http://www.w3.org/2013/07/webmobile-ig-charter.html), the
mission of the Web and Mobile Interest Group (also known as **WebMob**) is *to accelerate the
development of Web technology so that it becomes a compelling platform
for mobile applications and the obvious choice for cross platform
development*.

Current Status
--------------

We're working on the work plan for the group. At the moment this involves 
arranging regular teleconferences, planning deliverables and preparing for an initial face to face meeting - at
W3C TPAC in China in November (see [Meetings](#meetings)).

Please follow progress and [participate](#participate) by joining the [public mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-mobile/).

Background
----------

The Web and Mobile Interest Group (Webmob) has been formed to progress work started by the
[W3C Core Mobile Platform Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/coremob/) (Coremob), to progress work
started under the W3C [Closing the Gap with Native](http://www.w3.org/wiki/Closing_the_gap_with_native) Headlight Project
and to take on maintenance of  [Standards for Web Applications on Mobile](http://www.w3.org/2012/05/mobile-web-app-state/).

Web technology is a natural way to implement many applications that
today are widely implemented using native technology. There are felt to be a number of reasons why native technology is used. In part,
"apps" are perceived to be "the" approach to mobile. So there is
a need to educate and evangelise the advantages of a Web approach over a native approach. In addition, Web technology
does not today cover a sufficiently broad range of application use cases - because features have not been
standardised sufficiently or because implementation of standardised features has not been sufficiently consistent
to allow for straightforward development using them.

W3C Coremob's [Core Mobile Web Platform 2012](http://coremob.github.io/coremob-2012/FR-coremob-20130131.html) identified
a set of simple mobile use cases and analyzed the requirements on Web technology and the state of readiness of the
implementation of that technology.

The Web and Mobile Interest Group exists to help remedy the currently perceived weaknesses of the Web platform and
especially to help to develop the Web's inherent strengths, especially in respect of its cross platform nature.

Deliverables
------------

Planned deliverables:

-   [Core Mobile Web Platform 2012](http://coremob.github.io/coremob-2012/FR-coremob-20130131.html) Deployment Status

In short, we'd love people to get involved, whether you're a member of the W3C or not.
Anybody can (and should!) join the [publicly archived
mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-mobile/)
<public-web-mobile@w3.org> by sending a mail to <public-web-mobile-request@w3.org> with "subscribe" in the subject.

Work Mode
---------

The work done by the group is primarily carried out on our [publicly archived
mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-mobile/)
<public-web-mobile@w3.org>. Additionally, we hold [teleconferences](#teleconferences) to progress our work and we will hold a number of [face to face meetings](#f2fmeetings).

Action items and issues are tracked in the [group's tracker](http://www.w3.org/Mobile/IG/track/).

We use the [GitHub's w3c-webmob](https://github.com/w3c-webmob) account to manage a number of our deliverables, including [this Web site](https://github.com/w3c-webmob/w3c-webmob-website).

We use a [dedicated space in the W3C wiki](http://www.w3.org/wiki/Mobile/) as our scratch space for community contributions.

We use [the W3C IRC server](http://www.w3.org/Project/IRC/) (available also as a [Web app](http://irc.w3.org/)) on the \#webmob channel during our meetings to take minutes and manage action items. A number of the group participants (including the chairs and staff contacts) remain on the channel most of the time.

Logistical and administrative discussions can be addressed to the
[member-only archived mailing
list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-web-mobile/)
<member-web-mobile@w3.org>
